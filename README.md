# CPSC3383 Assignment 1.1

This is the final Assignment for class CPSC3383 Spring Semester

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to create a calculator that will preform calculations in "Reverse Polish Notation",
This is to demonstrate my ability design, implement and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements

## Description
In the assignment's instruction it states 

```
The program should make use of standard tools for creating/handling syntax
analysis and parsing such as lex(1)3
and yacc(1)4
```
Since this project is implemented in [TypeScript](#References), [Regex](#References) in combination with a [`Stack` data structure](#References) will be used to handle and parse the syntax of the calculations. 
The assignment requires testing, Unit tests will be implemented using [Jest Testing Library](#References).
* Although not required this project will be developed in a [TTD](#References) approach to improve my skills in the process.
* The project will be managed in a kanban board on the github website.
* At the end the project will be compiled into JS and served over the web using [gh-pages](#References).
